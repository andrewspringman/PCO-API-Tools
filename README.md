# PCO API Tools
A growing collection of Planning Center API Utilities.

## Latest changes
- Added JavaScript Song Transfer Class.

This script is a quick and dirty way to transfer JSON for all songs matching a tag.  On any page open the console, paste it in, make the edits as instructed in the comments, and press ENTER to run it.

## Goals
- Make an HTML version of Song Transfer Class JS with a form for the creds and tags
- upgrade to OAuth
- Create a library for JavaScript
- Create a library for PHP
- Create a library for GoLang
- Create a separate repo with PCO custom reports
