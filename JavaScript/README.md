# JavaScript PCO API Library
Only the Song Transfer Class, so far.  Do not despise the day of small beginnings.

## Song Transfer Class JS

This script is a quick and dirty way to transfer JSON for all songs matching a tag.  On any page open the console, paste it in, make the edits as instructed in the comments, and press ENTER to run it.

### Goals
- Make an HTML version of Song Transfer Class JS with a form for the creds and tags
- upgrade to OAuth
